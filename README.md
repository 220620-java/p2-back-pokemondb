# Project 2 - Pokémon Database Back End
The back end of our Pokémon Database. This will interact with the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to pull Pokémon data and construct a page containing data about a particular Pokémon along with fan comments and fanart.

## Description
Using the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) API, users will be able to do the following:
* View any Pokémon or get all Pokémon in a particular region.
* Add comments on a Pokémon page for tips or comments and like them.
* Add fanart to a Pokémon page and comment/like them.
* Add Pokémon to a wishlist to keep track of the ones they're trying to find.
* Register and log into an account.

Administrators can moderate comments and fanart and even ban users from posting.
